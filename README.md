# Data-Story-2
*Data Story 2* is a project that  aims to raise awareness of companies and organizations worldwide (especialy *Europe*) about the importance of **data privacy, protection and transparency**, as well as educate end users about their personal data use and its limits. It highlights the variations in **GDPR violations**' fines in Europe during **2020** and **2021** and the different **GDPR articles** that were neglected by the fined entities. This repository contains this *README file*, the *GDPR dataset* (excel), the *progress bar's dataset* (clean data) and the *R code file*.
